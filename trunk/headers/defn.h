 *   A null-terminated string representing the query. It consists of
 *   a space separated set of words. The length of any word will be at
 *	least MIN_WORD_LENGTH characters and at most MAX_WORD_LENGTH
 *	characters. The number of words in a query will not exceed

 * @param[in] match_type
 *   The type of mechanism used to consider a query as a
 *   match to any document, as specified in MatchType enumeration.
 *
 * @param[in] match_dist
 *   The hamming or edit distance (according to "match_type")
 *   threshold used as explained in MatchType enumeration.
 *   This parameter must be equal 0 for exact matching. The possible
 *   values of this parameter are 0,1,2,3.
 *   A query matches a document if and only if: for each word in
 *	the query, there exist a word in the document that matches it
 *	under the "match_type" and "match_dist" constraints. Note that
 *	the "match_dist" constraint is applied independently for each
 *	word in the query.
